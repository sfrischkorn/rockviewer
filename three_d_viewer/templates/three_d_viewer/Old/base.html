                      <p><h3>Welcome to 3DVOL â€“ Minerals.</h3><br><br>
						This website contains a three-dimensional virtual object library of the most important rock-forming minerals making up planet Earth. You will find information on:<br>
						<ul>
						  <li>Which are the most common minerals on Earth?</li>
						  <li>What are their most important physical and chemical properties?</li>
						<li>Where in the Earth and under which physical conditions do they form?</li>
						<li>How can they be identified in hand specimen?</li>
						</ul>
						A mineral is typically defined as an inorganic solid with a particular chemical composition and a characteristic, periodic atomic structure. 
						This characteristic atomic make-up is often reflected in the macroscopic crystalline structure of a mineral. 
						The 3D models presented on this website will help you to visualise, study, and memorise these beautiful and often 
						complex crystal structures as well as other diagnostic features of minerals.
						<br>
						We hope that you enjoy using 3DVOL.
						<br><br>
						Your 3DVOL team
